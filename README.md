## Concept

A slide puzzle with the goal of sorting gas emitting activities of humans to match them with the respective type of greenhouse gas while the temperature on earth is rising and years are passing by. 

While solving the puzzle, better understand the origins of greenhouse gases ...and maybe even reflect on your role in this. 

## Behind the idea

From the first time I heard about the Flutter Puzzle Hack, I knew I wanted to dedicate the project to the human caused climate change. After some brainstorming, I decided to extend the basic concept of a slide puzzle by telling a story rather - adding educational elements rather than simply extending game complexity. My goal was not to create an addictive game you play repeatedly but rather play it once and get something out of it. I wanted to create an atmosphere by utilizing animations and graphics to transport the message while the player is solving the puzzle. The message I thought about while developing the puzzle: 

> *To effectively address climate change, it is important to understand which actions have an actual impact on climate change.*

So instead of a "solution" puzzle with tiles of solar panels and electric cars, the puzzle takes a step back and focuses on the "problem" part of climate change: What human-based actions are causing climate change?

## Highlights

- Gas particles - randomly generated with different color, opacity, size, speed, direction values
- Atmosphere - pulsating animation to show steady emission output
- Puzzle tiles - self-designed graphics to represent greenhouse gas emitting activities
- Thermometer - steadily increasing temperature while playing to show predicted climate change until year 2100
- Airplanes - discreet animation to create a more vividly earth (extending concept in future versions)

## Inspiration

### Design

- [Flutter Dashatar Puzzle Challange](https://flutter.github.io/samples/slide_puzzle.html) - code base as starting point for puzzle functionality
- [Flutter Plasma by Felix Blaschke](https://flutterplasma.dev/) - "stars" inspiration for gas particles
